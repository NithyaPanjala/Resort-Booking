# Resort-Booking
This is a simple static Resort Booking Application built using only HTML. The project simulates a resort's online booking interface where users can view resort details and fill out a booking form.
Key features include:
A clean and structured layout with sections for resort overview, room types, and amenities
An HTML form to capture booking details like name, contact, check-in/check-out dates, and room preferences
Use of HTML5 elements like <form>, <section>, <input>, <textarea>, and <select> for better structure and accessibility
Designed as a frontend-only project â€” no CSS, JavaScript, or backend integration involved
This project demonstrates a basic understanding of HTML structure, semantic tags, and form creation for user input collection in a real-world context.
